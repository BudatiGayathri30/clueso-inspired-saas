# SmartDoc-AI [AI Video & Documentation SaaS Platform]

This project is a production-ready SaaS web application inspired by Clueso.io.
It demonstrates how AI can be used to transform screen recordings into
professional videos and step-by-step documentation.

## Scope Clarification
Clueso is a complex AI video processing platform.
This implementation focuses on replicating Clueso’s
core SaaS workflows, dashboard experience, and AI automation concepts
using mock data and simulated AI logic.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate product thinking,
system architecture, and full-stack integration rather than
real-time video processing pipelines.

## Features
- Authentication & Workspace onboarding
- Dashboard with usage metrics
- Video creation workflow (mocked)
- AI processing simulation
- Documentation generation
- AI insights dashboard
- Team & workspace management
- Secure multi-tenant data model

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
